Notes on cephalopods, including interesting research and culture. 

## Books and Documentaries 

* Mountain in the Sea 
    * Contains interesting facts about octopuses, such as that unlike chameleons, which use hormones to change color, octopuses use nerve cells, so can change color much more quickly. 
    * Nosferatu pose
    * That the limbs are controlled quasi-independently 
    * That octopuses can change both color and texture 
    * Octopuses make dens/gardens 
        * So the Beatles song Octopus's Garden is about an actual thing that really exists, not a psychedelic hallucination, haha 
    * Limitations on octopuses (short lifespan, not caring for young after birth), and what would be necessary for octopuses to evolve intelligence 
    * Interesting digressions on consciousness 
* Squid Empire (later Cephalopods, Monarchs of the Sea)
    * Engaging, high-quality science writing 
* PBS Documentary: Making Contact 
    * Fascinating clip of an octopus changing both color and texture to blend in with a rock

    * "In humans and many other animals, a centralized brain makes a majority of the decisions. In an octopus, most of the 'brain' is distributed, not centralized, along the eight arms, meaning each appendage can act independently but also in a coordinated fashion."

        * What is "ontogeny"?  From Wikipedia, "Ontogeny (also ontogenesis) is the origination and development of an organism (both physical and psychological, e.g., moral development[1]), usually from the time of fertilization of the egg to adult. The term can also be used to refer to the study of the entirety of an organism's lifespan."  Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontogeny
