* Viewing and adding remotes
  * Run `git remote` to see the shortnames of your remotes
    * "If you've cloned your repository, you should at least see `origin`-- that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from." 
  * Run `git remote -v` to see the shortname and url of each remote repository 
  * To add a new remote: `git remote add <shortname> <url>` 
* Pulling data from remotes 
  * `git fetch <remote>` fetches data but does not merge 
  * If your current branch tracks a remote branch, you can use `git pull` to download and merge data 
    * `git clone` sets up your local `main` branch to track the remote default branch
