## How to stream to YouTube from OBS.  
1) In YouTube, click on the `Create` button, then `go live`. Edit the details/medatadata. 
2) If you have not already entered the stream key in OBS, then in OBS, click on Settings, then select Stream in the menu on the left. Choose YouTube and enter the stream key. 
3) In OBS, click Start Streaming, then select Existing Stream, and choose the YouTube stream that you set up in Step 1. 
4) In YouTube, look at the mini window in the upper left to confirm that the stream is live. 

## Lessons Learned 

* Before the actual stream, first stream for a few minutes then rewatch to check that the stream layout is arranged correctly. 
* When you type in VS Code, autocomplete boxes pop up frequently, which are distracting and somewhat unpleasant to look at if your goal is to just type text that people can read. 

## Issues/problems 

* Sometimes the video flickers. 
* If you choose "Window Capture" as your source, then the mouse is not visible. 
* A stream with no music or talking is boring... maybe I should figure out how to add background music.
