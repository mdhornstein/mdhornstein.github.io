### Finishing Projects 

[Finish your projects](https://github.com/readme/guides/finish-your-projects) by Aaron Francis.  

> There's no way around it: Finishing a project takes a certain amount of pure, unpleasant work. The first step is to embrace the fact that it won't be fun all the way through. You must become comfortable with the grind-it-out nature of the last 10% of a project. This is what separates people who finish from people who wish they could. 

> Doing that last bit of work isn’t glamorous, there are no shortcuts, and there are no hacks. There’s only work. But let this be a comfort to you! No one accomplishes anything great without sitting down at their desk every day and fighting for it. 

> Finishing is a skill, and you can hone it.

Spelunky book by Derek Yu 
* "finishing is a skill as much as being able to design, draw, program, or make music, and that finished projects are more valuable than unfinished projects" 
* "Use awards, competitions, and other events as real deadlines." 
* "Push forward. Don't get hung up on one part of the game for too long." 
* "Take care of your mental and physical health." 
* "Remember that the last 10% is the last 90%. You're never as close to being finished as you think you are." 
* "I'm obsessed with finishing as a skill. Over the years, I've realized that so many of the good things that have come my way are because I was able to finish what I started."

John Carmack 
* "Embrace the grind...It takes more than just 'be bold'; you have to actually work really hard. You've gotta fill your products with 'give a damn.'"
* "Not many of our applications [in the Oculus store] are going that extra mile where all the really important magic and user value happens."


[Embrace the grind](https://jacobian.org/2021/apr/7/embrace-the-grind/)

> The only “trick” is that this preparation seems so boring, so impossibly tedious, that when we see the effect we can’t imagine that anyone would do something so tedious just for this simple effect.



### Emotions

* "Leadership is a lonely business. You live 24/7 with uncertainty, anxiety, and the fear of personal failure. You make countless decisions, and being wrong about any of them might let down your employees and investors. The stakes, both financial and human, are high. And what adds to the terror is that there is no manual, no how-to guide. Every problem has, at least to some extent, never been seen before. In particular, early-stage enterprises often feel like they're shrouded in a fog of war." Frank Slootman, Amp It Up
