John Carmack 
* "Embrace the grind...It takes more than just 'be bold'; you have to actually work really hard. You've gotta fill your products with 'give a damn.'"
* "Not many of our applications [in the Oculus store] are going that extra mile where all the really important magic and user value happens."


[Embrace the grind](https://jacobian.org/2021/apr/7/embrace-the-grind/)

> The only “trick” is that this preparation seems so boring, so impossibly tedious, that when we see the effect we can’t imagine that anyone would do something so tedious just for this simple effect.



### Emotions

* "Leadership is a lonely business. You live 24/7 with uncertainty, anxiety, and the fear of personal failure. You make countless decisions, and being wrong about any of them might let down your employees and investors. The stakes, both financial and human, are high. And what adds to the terror is that there is no manual, no how-to guide. Every problem has, at least to some extent, never been seen before. In particular, early-stage enterprises often feel like they're shrouded in a fog of war." Frank Slootman, Amp It Up
