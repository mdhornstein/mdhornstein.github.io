## Brainstorming ideas for an Apps Script project 

* Apps Script lets us connect to Google Services 
* We need to figure out how to get data into and out of Google Apps.  Maybe we can use the Python Google Drive API. 
* We can probably have some automated systems to get data into Google Sheets. 
* Though we probably risk filling up our storage if we have too much data in Google Sheets. 
* So maybe we should just use Google Sheets for "summary statistics" rather than as our data warehouse. 
* Maybe Google Sheets is not where we should store our training data for machine learning.  
* I wonder if we can use Apps Script to create some kind of personal assistant. 
* Can Apps Script interact with Google Meet?
